## Overview

This project is an implementation of the classic 4-in-a-row game in C++. The objective of the game is to connect four of your pieces in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, before your opponent does.

## Project Details

### Language and Paradigm

The entire project was developed in C++, utilizing object-oriented programming (OOP) principles for a modular and organized codebase.

### Game Rules

The 4-in-a-row game is a two-player turn-based strategy game. Each player takes turns dropping one of their colored discs from the top into any of the seven columns. The disc then falls down to the lowest empty space within the selected column.

### Extra Features

- **Customizable Winning Conditions:** Players can choose the number of pieces needed to win, adding flexibility to the game's difficulty and strategy.
  
- **Adjustable Board Size:** The size of the game board is customizable, allowing players to tailor the game environment based on their preferences.
 
- **Three Levels of CPU Difficulties:** The game offers three distinct levels of CPU difficulty, providing players with a range of challenges to suit their skill level.

- **Result Logging:** Game results are automatically saved in a .txt file, with the exact date of each game, allowing players to review and analyze their gameplay history.

## How to Run

To run the game on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your computer.
2. Open the project in your preferred C++ development environment.
3. Compile and run the main file ([Origem.cpp](Project_w_classes/x64/Debug/Origem.cpp)).
